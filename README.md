## Key Concepts for Beginners

### **1. Missing Values**
In datasets, some features may have missing or invalid data. In this project:
- The `Horsepower` feature contains missing values.
- We replace missing values with the **median** to avoid introducing bias.

### **2. Feature Scaling**
Features like `Weight` and `Displacement` have much larger ranges compared to others, which can negatively impact models like Neural Networks. Two common scaling methods are:
1. **Min-Max Scaling**: Rescales features to a range of 0 to 1.
2. **Standardization**: Rescales features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

### **3. Linear Regression**
Linear Regression is a simple regression model that fits a straight line to predict the target variable (`MPG`).

### **4. Neural Network Regression**
Neural Networks are advanced models capable of capturing complex relationships between features and the target variable. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes.
